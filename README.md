# moneycalc
This is a money calculator I used to see how much money I would make before and after taxes on a pay check from my summer job. 
It has a couple simple inputs, and works best for people trying to calculate their paycheck who get hourly wages. 
Note: this works specifically for wisconsin, and is a pretty accurate ESTIMATE. If you want to use this and are in a different state, you just need to change the tax info/rates.
